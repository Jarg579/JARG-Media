Congratulations! You've done enough digging to find this page!
The cursed art folder has been reinstated in its final form, 
Due to your efforts.

There is a method to unlock the other prize folders, 
But that is revealed within the puzzles that have not been discovered yet.

The prize folders contained here are a conglomeration 
Of things we wanted to share, and that you've earned 
Due to the amount of time that's invested in solving these mysteries. 


There are 3 subfolders that separate the different categories:

Awards:
A collection of wallpapers, cool art, and 3D print files for 
your viewing pleasure.

Beta:
The beta folder contains a large number of WIP's.
Spoopy Soup's first drafts. 
bte0601's 3d modeling. 
TheAdvertisement's and Tortoise's test sprites.
Most were made almost a year ago when the project began.

Cursed:
This "reward" is a mix of weird or otherwise cursed things 
that we made as jokes during the course of the
project. Some are inside jokes we know of, and others
are just... weird. Hope you enjoy?
